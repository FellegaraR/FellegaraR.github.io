    abstract = "The efficient representation of simplicial meshes is an active research topic in several fields, including geometric modeling, computer graphics, scientific visualization, and geographic data processing. Managing complexes in three dimensions and higher is not a simple task since the data structures proposed for three dimensions are quite large and are even larger when considering complexes in four dimensions and higher. Simplicial meshes have received great attention, since their combinatorial properties make them easier to understand, represent and manipulate than more general cell complexes. Furthermore, current implementations cannot always keep large complexes entirely in system memory (in-core) and some out-of-core approaches, for example using a spatial data base, are intrinsically slow. There are two fundamental categories of queries proposed in the literature for interacting with simplicial meshes: those based on spatial locality and those based on topological connectivity. Spatial information can be retrieved through spatial queries, that are accelerated through the use of a spatial indexing structure, a data structure that supports the efficient organization of spatially near complexes. Topological connectivity information can be retrieved through topological queries. These are accelerated by using a topological data structure, a data structure that supports the efficient reconstruction of a subset of the local topological connectivity of the mesh as well as navigation. In general, topological data structures tend to be inefficient for spatial queries, while spatial indexes exhibit a high overhead when executing topological queries. The aim my research is to develop new data structures for simplicial and cellular meshes in three dimensions and higher, based on spatial indexes and topological data structures. The final goal is to find optimized data structures that combine the features of the topological and spatial approach in a common framework.
