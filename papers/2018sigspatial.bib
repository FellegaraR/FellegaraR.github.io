  abstract  = {Computing with trajectories has become an important and practical research topic. In many scenarios, the goal is to find similar trajectories. The Fr\'{e}chet distance is a very promising metric for measuring trajectory similarity and yet limited in practical applications due to its expensive computing complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate an efcicient approach to retrieve similar trajectories using the Fr\'{e}chet distance. Essentially, the proposed method builds up a set of R-trees for indexing trajectories and thereby enables multi-level of positive and negative filtering to speed up the similarity queries. For answering 5,000 queries on a dataset of 20,000 trajectories, the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant speedups at certain filtering levels while maintaining very high precision and recall in retrieving similar trajectories.},
