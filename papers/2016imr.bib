    abstract = "While the vast majority of mesh processing tools assume a manifold mesh, many available meshes do not satisfy these constraints due to geometric defects and non-manifold singularities. We propose an efficient technique, based on a simple and compact data structure, for verifying topological properties of arbitrary simplicial complexes and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness.
