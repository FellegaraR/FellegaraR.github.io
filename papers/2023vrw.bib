  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a software architecture and framework developed over the past decade to enable scalable and highly interactive visualizations for large datasets and display sizes. The framework integrates distributed data processing, data streaming, and dynamic scheduling to allow for view-dependent feature extraction and progressive data streaming. Additionally, the framework has been designed to support visualizations from local desktop workstations to large multi-display virtual environments.},
